  Gatsby's RDF-based website starter
</h1>

Kick off your project with this RDF-based boilerplate.
This starter ships with the [Gatsby RDFSite theme](https://github.com/dice-group/gatsby-theme-rdf) and all the configuration files you might need to get up and running blazing fast with the blazing fast app generator for React.

## 🚀 Quick start

1.  **Create a Gatsby site.**

    Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the RDFSite starter.

    ```shell
    # create a new Gatsby site using the rdfsite starter
    gatsby new my-rdfsite-starter https://github.com/dice-group/gatsby-template-rdfsite
    ```

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new site’s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd my-rdfsite-starter/
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `my-rdfsite-starter` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `pages/contact.mdx`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

## 🧐 What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a Gatsby project.

    .
    ├── node_modules
    ├── data
    ├── images
    ├── pages
    ├── src/gatsby-theme-rdfsite
    ├── .dockerignore
    ├── .exoframeignore
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── Dockerfile
    ├── exoframe.json
    ├── gatsby-config.js
    ├── package.json
    ├── README.md
    └── yarn.lock

1.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

2.  **`/data`**: This directory will contain all of the RDF data related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as partners, people and publications.

3.  **`/images`**: This directory will contain all of the images used on your website, they will be automatically optimized during build.

4.  **`/pages`**: This directory will contain all of the markdown (MD or MDX) pages used on your website such as contacts, deliverables and news.

5.  **`/src/gatsby-theme-rdfsite`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to overrides of the RDFSite theme components. For more info on overrides, see [Gatsby theme shadowing docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/themes/shadowing/).

6.  **`.dockerignore`**: This file tells docker which files it should ignore during build to make your image lighter.

7.  **`.exoframeignore`**: This file tells exoframe which files it should ignore during deploy to reduce data transfer size.

8.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

9.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you’d like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

10. **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

11. **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.

12. **`yarn.json`** (See `package.json` above, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. **(You won’t change this file directly).**

## 🎓 Learning Gatsby

Looking for more guidance? Full documentation for Gatsby lives [on the website](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). Here are some places to start:

- **For most developers, we recommend starting with our [in-depth tutorial for creating a site with Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/).** It starts with zero assumptions about your level of ability and walks through every step of the process.

- **To dive straight into code samples, head [to our documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/).** In particular, check out the _Guides_, _API Reference_, and _Advanced Tutorials_ sections in the sidebar.
